The scripts in this folder just work for two overlapping peptides. RNAsampleCDS is a generalized version of these programs. 
The only difference is the length of the final sequences:
overcode-0.py: for peptides of length n outputs sequences of length 3*n coding two peptides in +0 and -0 reading frames.
overcode+1.py: for peptides of length n outputs sequences of length 3*n+1 coding two peptides in +0 and +1 reading frames.
overcode+2.py: for peptides of length n outputs sequences of length 3*n+2 coding two peptides in +0 and +2 reading frames.
overcode-1.py: for peptides of length n outputs sequences of length 3*n+1 coding two peptides in +0 and -1 reading frames.
overcode-2.py: for peptides of length n outputs sequences of length 3*n+2 coding two peptides in +0 and -2 reading frames.
